Understand "combine [something] with [something]" as combining it with.

[The line below tells Inform7 that combining produces something.]
The combining it with action has an object called the Contraption.

Setting action variables for combining something with something: 
	let X be a list of objects;
	add the noun to X;
	add the second noun to X;
	sort X; 
	repeat through the Table of Arm Parts: 
		let Y be the parts list entry; 
		sort Y; 
		if X is Y: 
			now the Contraption is the results entry.

[if there is no match for the combination of things, there is no result for the combining, so STOP the action]
Check combining it with:
	if Contraption is nothing:
		say "You can't combine [the noun] and [the second noun] into anything useful.[line break]Try another combination of things.";
		stop the action.

[If action is not stopped, continue toâ€¦]
Carry out combining it with: 
	say "You fuse together [the noun] and [the second noun].";
	remove the noun from play;
	remove the second noun from play;
	move the Contraption to the player.

Report combining it with:
	say "You now have a [a Contraption]."
